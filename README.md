#rather to achieve Artificial consciousness, we need to think about the road/pathway to achieve artificial consciousness. The idea of artificial consciousness is perhaps a bit too risky, that we cannot fully interpret and control yet. However, I am confident that with the development on the way, we can harvest some of the most interesting "sideproducts" : AGI. AGI refers to the artificial general intelligence, where it can performs any tasks just like a human does. My focus is to try to simulate/create a small/simple version of AGI application in clinical medicine, using AI to help recognise not only emotions, but pain level.

concept: Use the existing facial recognition database and application as a start, further allow the model to learn more complicated data like muscle movement when painful. Another thought is to combine it with various devices: health monitoring devices to assist to have a more accurate prediction of the pain level, which helps the doctors to assist. Furthermore, I hope to build a base for the future AI doctors to be able to give social care to patients, enhancing their capabilities:

First, use OpenCV to allow the capture of facial expressions;
A very small sections of code allowing faces to be extracted:
